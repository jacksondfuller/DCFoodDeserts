    "Though this analysis of food insecurity in Washington, DC we can see very strong correlations between race/income and grocery stores in Washington DC. This shows the systemic factors behind food insecurity in Washington, DC. There is also a moderate correlation between the number of metro stations in each ward and the number of grocery stores in a ward. These correlations reveal the inequal nature of resources in Washington, DC that lead to food inequity. In order to resolve this in the short term, the city of Washington, DC requires mandates for new grocery stores and fresh food locations in Wards 7 and 8. However, for long-term success, the city should consider addressing the underlying factors by introducing programs to increase access to postsecondary institutions, enforcement of labor laws to reduce exploitation of low-skilled workers, and providing greater availabilities for low-income residents to find housing throughout all of DC instead of in segregated neighborhoods."
